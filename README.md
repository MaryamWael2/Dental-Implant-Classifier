# Dental Implant Classifier

This project focuses on utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify different types of dental implants based on X-ray images. Dental implants are critical for patients to restore the full ability to chew, often indistinguishable from natural teeth. However, when implant fractures occur, identifying the specific implant type for repair can be challenging due to the variety of dental implant brands.

## Project Overview

Dental implants are titanium posts attached to the jawbone, replacing tooth roots and supporting new teeth. Identifying the correct type of implant from X-ray images is challenging due to over 50 similar implant varieties. Deep learning, particularly using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), helps solve this by mimicking human neural processes, making it useful for classifying dental implants from medical images for accurate identification and diagnosis.

## Datasets

Our dataset, collected by several dentists, comprises 60 different types of dental implants, organized into 60 distinct folders. Each folder contains multiple X-ray images, with a total of 2,363 X-rays across the entire dataset.Our dataset, collected by several dentists, comprises 60 different types of dental implants, organized into 60 distinct folders.

## Models

Several deep learning models were trained and tested to classify dental implant types:

1. AlexNet
2. VGG16 (with and without transfer learning)
3. ResNet50
4. GoogleLeNet
5. Ensemble Model

## Model Performance

The model's performance is assessed by its ability to accurately classify the implant type, using accuracy as the evaluation metric.
